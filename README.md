# portfoliofriend_app
 App allows user to check risk metrics for any asset where price info is available on yahoo finance.  

This repo contains updated(Jun/23) code to run app locally. Streamlit is updated to current version. App was run amd tested in a virtual environmnent locally which is the suggested way to test and work with this locally.  
Streamlit when installed will also install numpy and pandas among many other libraries and there risk is if you dont run in a virtual environemnt you may create issues or conflicts with these libraries in your base or main directories.
