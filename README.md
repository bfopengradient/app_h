# portfoliofriend_app

The app allows users to check risk metrics for any asset for which price information is available on Yahoo Finance.

The .py file contains a reference to a .png logo image file. That logo file is intentionally not included. Substitute your own .png file or your logo file in place.
Â 
This repo contains updated June 23 code to run the app locally. It also works with a more recent version of Streamlit. The app was tested in a virtual environment. Streamlit, when installed, will also install Numpy and Pandas, among many other libraries, and there is a risk that if you don't run in a virtual environment, you may create conflicts with these libraries in your base or main directories.

Once you have installed the libraries from the requirements.txt file in your virtual environment, you just need to run the following code in your terminal: streamlit run portfoliofriend.py

A window will open in your browser, and the app should be good to go.
